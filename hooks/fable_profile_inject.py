"""fable-mode Profile Injector  (SessionStart hook).

When a project has opted into fable-mode (`.fable/` dir present), auto-inject
the fable-mode discipline + the model-appropriate tier at session start, so you
don't have to type "use fable mode" every time. Also re-surfaces open ledger
items for context recovery on resume.

Inert unless a `.fable/` dir is found  ->  keeps fable-mode opt-in at the
project level while auto-selecting the tier at the model level.
Fail-open: any error  ->  exit 0 with no output.

Tier selection (env FABLE_MODE_PROFILE overrides: auto|conservative|throughput):
  model contains "fable"  ->  throughput (aggressive parallel delegation)
  otherwise / model absent ->  conservative (<=5 concurrent, inline-first)

Graceful degradation: a conservative (non-Fable) session also gets a
"don't defer to a stronger model, don't stall" instruction, so work never gets
stuck waiting for a Fable 5 the user can't run. Set FABLE_ESCALATION=on to opt
out (you genuinely have a stronger tier available).
