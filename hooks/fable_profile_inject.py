"""fable-mode Profile Injector  (SessionStart hook).

When a project has opted into fable-mode (`.fable/` dir present), inject the
discipline at session start — sized to the ledger state, so a big project's
small tasks aren't taxed:

  starting  (.fable/ but no task cards)  -> full injection (guide the round)
  active    (ledger has open `- [ ]`)    -> full injection + context recovery
  idle      (all cards closed)           -> minimal one-liner; quick work flows
  paused    (a `PAUSED` line in ledger)  -> one-liner; enforcement off except
                                            the model ceiling

Also caches {session_id -> model} so the spawn guard can enforce the model
ceiling (PreToolUse hooks never receive `model`).

Inert unless `.fable/` is found. Fail-open: any error -> exit 0, no output.
Tier: model contains "fable" -> throughput, else conservative
(env FABLE_MODE_PROFILE=auto|conservative|throughput overrides).
FABLE_ESCALATION=on marks a stronger tier as genuinely available.
